      "You’ve found the house of your dreams – but you want to make sure the costly nightmare of dry rot isn’t lurking under the carpets and skirting boards. The solution? Call in the dogs! The appropriately named Mark Doggett has trained his two animals to sniff out the destructive fungus in old houses where it can hide in places a person would miss. Mr Doggett gave up a ten-year career in construction after hitting on the idea to set up a business using the animals’ sense of smell, which is said to be up to a million times better than that of humans. Skilled: Meg and Jess, pictured with Mark Doggett, were trained for six months to sniff out dry rot . On the case: Four-year-old Border collie Meg gets down to work sniffing out the destructive fungus . When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal . After six months of training, four-year-old border collie Meg and 22-month-old English springer spaniel Jess went to work. When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal. The businessman, 30, from Wolverhampton, whose company is called Enviro-Dogs, said: ‘We’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public. The dogs can go out to domestic properties or surveyors can hire us as part of their report. Dry rot is wood decay caused by the fungus Serpula lacrymans that digests the parts of the wood which give it strength. By the time there are visible signs, serious damage will have been done. It begins as a microscopic spore but the final stage is a fruiting body which pumps out new spores. Once airborne they can damage all parts of a property, penetrating brickwork and concrete floors seeking a wood source. If not treated, it can destroy a building. “It’s not really work for the dogs – they see it as the best game in the world and they enjoy it because it’s working on their natural instincts. The dogs are so effective because they can detect dry rot at much earlier stages. ‘In hidden places dry rot can grow for years without anyone noticing it. It can be hard to find but the dogs can detect it through carpet and wall panelling. ‘It takes a couple of minutes for the dog to search a room. People are slightly dubious when they first hear about us but after seeing what we can do they’re amazed.’ Prices start at £200 for a call-out and the business has been so successful Mr Doggett plans to expand it by training the dogs to hunt out bed bugs for hotels and hospitals. The businessman, 30, from Wolverhampton, whose company is called Enviro-Dogs, said: ‘We’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public.' By the time there are visible signs of dry rot, serious damage will have been done . To call out Mr Doggett and his pair of sniffer dogs to hunt for dry rot cost £200 .

The chilly continent recorded the temperature (15.5 degrees Celsius) on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica, according to the Weather Underground. The temperature was recorded at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. (Note to map lovers: The Argentine base is not geographically part of the South American continent.) The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said Randy Cerveny, the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and Arizona State University professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall.

      "(CNN)When photographer Johan Bavman became a father for the first time, he took more than a passing wonder about how his native Sweden is said to be the most generous nation on Earth for parental leave. He immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over, you might say. He used his photography to document the real-life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of Sweden's extraordinary program, which allows mothers and fathers to take long, long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns. Get this: Sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave, with 390 of them paid at 80% of income, with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $3,474. The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day, or $22. But there's a catch. Fathers have to share that leave with mothers. So to promote both parents to raise their children, Sweden has mandated that 60 of the 480 days be \"daddy months\" or \"partner months.\" If the 60 daddy days aren't used, they are lost, reducing the maximum leave to 420 days. The country also created a \"gender equality bonus\": the more days that parents share the leave equally, they get a bonus that could total up to 1,500 euros, or $1,649. The idea is for both parents to share the joys and struggles of raising infants. In reality, only 12% of Swedish couples equally share the 480 days of leave, Bavman said, with women continuing to lead the way as the stay-at-home parent and men as the careerist. Still, Bavman mused last summer about how the policy impacts those men who use the full measure of their parental leave. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. At first, Bavman had difficulty finding such men. But the fathers he did find and photograph, he captured their devotion in realistic imagery. \"I realized while I was talking to these dads, these dads are struck by how important the bonding is between you and the children,\" said Bavman, who now has a 3-year-old son, Viggo, with partner Linda Stark, a freelance journalist. \"I didn't want to bring out fathers as superdads,\" Bavman said. \"I wanted to bring out these role models which people can connect to. \"I want to have those dads who can also show their tiredness ... which comes with being home with your children. It's a hard full-time job. This is something that we have been taking for granted for hundreds of years. This is something that mothers have never been recognized for.\" He also found moments of humor, with one child nearly ripping apart the shirt of his busy father. The fathers have become more understanding of their wives and even their own mothers, Bavman said. Some are now considering a career change to accommodate their parenthood. \"Being home nine months, they get time to think about their life,\" the photographer said. Bavman is looking for a total of 60 fathers to photograph, to culminate in an exhibition and a book. So far he's found 35 worthy of his lens. Johan Bavman is a freelance photographer based in Malmo, Sweden. From 2008-2011, he worked as a staff photographer at Sydsvenskan, one of Sweden's largest newspapers.\n",

      "A female prison guard and the convict she helped escape have been caught after 19 days and 1,700 miles on the run. Rachel Chepulis, 26, was arrested with Wesley E. Brown III in North Bend, Oregon almost three weeks after she helped him break out of Lake Region Correctional Center, also known as Devils Lake, in North Dakota. 35-year-old Brown, who is married with children, was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm - and is thought to have seduced single Chepulis while behind bars. Fugitive couple: Female prison guard Rachel Chepulis and felon Wesley E. Brown III have been captured in Oregon after she helped him escape from jail in North Dakota 19 days ago . His escape from Devils Lake on March 13., aided by Chepulis, is the second time he has broken out of a secure unit. In June 2013 he escaped from Heart of America Correctional Center, climbing over a fence at the prison's recreation area. On that occasion Brown was recaptured three hours later and transferred to Devils Lake prison, where he spent a considerable amount of time prior his second jail break in March. Dan Orr, chief deputy U.S. marshal for North Dakota, told the Daily News: 'It's clear in the time he was there they developed a relationship. That he was allowed to escape was assisted by the fact there were mistakes made by the jail. Caught: The pair managed to get 1,700 miles from the North Dakota jail before being captured in Oregon . 'He was classified at a lower level than he should have been considering he already escaped from another facility. And he had assistance from the female jailer. 'It was pretty clear the jail didn't realize what she had done. But once we began the investigation, we realized she had a direct involvement in the escape.' The Marshals Service relies on local jails to hold federal prisoners awaiting sentencing in North Dakota and during his time at Devils Lake, the convicted Brown must have befriended the single Chepulis, Mr Orr claimed. The fugitive couple was caught outside a Bi-Mart store in North Bend yesterday with the help of Oregon State Police, who tracked down Chepulis' 2015 Toyota Rav4 with North Dakota plates after a tip off from a nearby hotel. Chepulis, arrested as she returned to the vehicle, was found to have Brown's initials tattooed on her left ring finger. Married felon: Brown, who has a wife and childre, is thought to have befriended single Rachel Chepulis while locked up at Lake Region Correctional Center, also known as Devils Lake, in North Dakota, above . Brown is to face additional escape charges while Chepulis will be hit with instigating or assisting an escape, concealing a person from arrest and conspiracy to commit escape . Each charge carries a five-year prison sentence. The pair will be arraigned in Oregon, likely Thursday, and then held without bond as they face extradition to North Dakota. Mr Orr said he was unable to offer more details of the jail break or the couple's time on the run until the court affidavit is unsealed.\n",

      "You’ve found the house of your dreams – but you want to make sure the costly nightmare of dry rot isn’t lurking under the carpets and skirting boards. The solution? Call in the dogs! The appropriately named Mark Doggett has trained his two animals to sniff out the destructive fungus in old houses where it can hide in places a person would miss. Mr Doggett gave up a ten-year career in construction after hitting on the idea to set up a business using the animals’ sense of smell, which is said to be up to a million times better than that of humans. Skilled: Meg and Jess, pictured with Mark Doggett, were trained for six months to sniff out dry rot . On the case: Four-year-old Border collie Meg gets down to work sniffing out the destructive fungus . When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal . After six months of training, four-year-old border collie Meg and 22-month-old English springer spaniel Jess went to work. When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal. The businessman, 30, from Wolverhampton, whose company is called Enviro-Dogs, said: ‘We’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public. The dogs can go out to domestic properties or surveyors can hire us as part of their report. Dry rot is wood decay caused by the fungus Serpula lacrymans that digests the parts of the wood which give it strength. By the time there are visible signs, serious damage will have been done. It begins as a microscopic spore but the final stage is a fruiting body which pumps out new spores. Once airborne they can damage all parts of a property, penetrating brickwork and concrete floors seeking a wood source. If not treated, it can destroy a building. “It’s not really work for the dogs – they see it as the best game in the world and they enjoy it because it’s working on their natural instincts. The dogs are so effective because they can detect dry rot at much earlier stages. ‘In hidden places dry rot can grow for years without anyone noticing it. It can be hard to find but the dogs can detect it through carpet and wall panelling. ‘It takes a couple of minutes for the dog to search a room. People are slightly dubious when they first hear about us but after seeing what we can do they’re amazed.’ Prices start at £200 for a call-out and the business has been so successful Mr Doggett plans to expand it by training the dogs to hunt out bed bugs for hotels and hospitals. The businessman, 30, from Wolverhampton, whose company is called Enviro-Dogs, said: ‘We’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public.' By the time there are visible signs of dry rot, serious damage will have been done . To call out Mr Doggett and his pair of sniffer dogs to hunt for dry rot cost £200 . Mr Doggett now plans to train his dogs to sniff out bed bugs for hospitals and hotels .\n",
